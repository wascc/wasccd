# wasmCloud

wasmCloud lets you focus on shipping _features_. Build secure, portable, re-usable components called **_actors_** and get rid of the headaches that come from being smothered by boilerplate, dependency hell, tight coupling, and making design decisions mandated by your infrastructure.

## Distributed computing, _simplified_

The wasmCloud runtime is a vessel for running actors and capability providers in the cloud, at the edge, in the browser, on small devices, and anywhere else you can imagine.

If you're new to the wasmCloud ecosystem, a great place to start is the [getting started](https://wasmcloud.dev/overview/getting-started/) section of our [documentation](https://wasmcloud.dev).

You can also take a look at a wide range of [examples](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples) in our Github repository, or look through the [reference applications](https://wasmcloud.dev/reference/refapps/) we've created as technology demonstrations to help illustrate a new way of designing, composing, and building applications.

## Rust Runtime

The wasmCloud host runtime is available both as a released binary and as a [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/wasmcloud-host) that you can incorporate in your own applications to create bespoke, fit-for-purpose hosts.
